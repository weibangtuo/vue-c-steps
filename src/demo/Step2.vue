    <h1>Using an Oven</h1>
    <article>
      <p>Because there is very little air flow, roasting coffee beans in the oven can sometimes lead to a somewhat uneven roast. However, the lack of air flow can also increase the richness of the flavor if the oven is correctly used.</p>

        <h2>Preheat your oven to 450 °F (232 °C)</h2>
        <p>While your oven is preheating, ready your pan. For this method you will need a baking sheet that has many small holes or slots and a lip that will keep all of the beans in the pan. These pans can be found at any kitchen supply store.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you don’t want to buy a new pan but happen to have an old baking sheet with a lip lying around, you can actually make your own roasting sheet. Take your pan and use a ⅛ inch drill bit to carefully drill holes into the sheet. The holes should be ½ inch away from each other and small enough that none of the beans will fall through them.
