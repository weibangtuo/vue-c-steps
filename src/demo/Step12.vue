    <h1>Know that the length of your roast is based on the color of the beans</h1>
    <article>
      <p>While you will start out with ‘green’ beans, when they begin to roast, your beans will go through a whole array of color. A good rule of thumb is to keep in mind that the darker the bean, the fuller the body of the bean.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Light brown: This color is generally avoided as it can result in a sour taste. The body is weak, the aroma medium and the sweetness low.</li>
        <li>Light-medium brown: This roast is common in the eastern United States. It has a full body, a full aroma, and a mild sweetness.</li>
        <li>Full medium brown: This is a common roast in the Western United States. It has a full body, strong aroma, and mild sweetness.</li>
        <li>Medium-dark brown: This roast is also known as a Light French or Viennese roast. It has a very full body, a strong aroma, and a strong sweetness.</li>
        <li>Dark brown: This is known as espresso or French. It has a full body, a medium aroma, and a full sweetness.</li>
        <li>Very dark (nearly black): This is also known as Spanish and Dark French. It has a weak body, a mild aroma, and a low sweetness.</li>
